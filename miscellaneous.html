        What is the nearest star to earth ?<br><br>
        Its the sun. At 8 light minutes.<br><br>
        What is the nearest star to earth other than sun ?<br><br>
        It's the Alpha Centauri A. At 4.3 light years. <br><br>
        Alpha Centauri A is the biggest star humans have ever discovered. With our current capabality of a spacecraft 
        reaching 18 km/s, it would roughly take 18000 years to get to Alpha Centauri A. For reference this time is equal 
        to humans setting up their first civilisation to our modern day society. <br><br>

        <b>This is image of Alpha Centauri from NASA's photo gallery. There is also an X-ray closeup of Alpha Centauri</b><br><br>
        </div>

        <div> fastest man-made object is the Parker Solar Probe by NASA, launched in 2018 to observe sun. It hit a maximum
        speed of 192 km/s. So what if we realise a big black hole is closing in on earth in 50 years, what can we our best
        shot on escaping the solar system ? Here is a list of option what we can do.<br><br>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <div><li>Nuclear Weapons : <br>
            Simply we have to load a starship and put half a million 1 megaton Nuclear warheads and one by one detonate 
            them outside using that momentum to speed up. Doing it would accelerate the ship possibly to 1/10th of speed 
            of light (30,000 km/s). The astronauts would get to Alpha Cen in just 43 years. But yeah there are a lot of 
            issues. First of all we need to slow down on the other end. And we can't just hit the brakes on a rocket 
            travelling at 30,000 km/s. We'd need to once again detonate just as many nukes, but this time in front of the 
            starship. So half of our fuel goes to de-accelerate. And there should be a lot of safety issues about a ship 
            with a thousand gigaton worth nuclear weapons onboard. And to produce so many nukes we have to revive the 
            cold war.<br><br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/mTVOn6u.png" width="550" height="300" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br><br>
            </li></div>
            
            <div><li>Solar Sails : <br>
            Attaching a reflective panel a few kilometer in diameter to the rocket, then having a giant laser shoot at it 
            could accelerate the ship to even greater speed than nukes. The idea of light sails is actually planned to be 
            used in small probes. But when it comes to huge starships, we again have an issue. <br>
            Constructive the reflective pane isn't a big problem, it can be done in space. The harder part is to construct 
            a laser powerful enough to accelerate the ship, possibly equivalent to hundreds of nuclear plants. It would 
            be ineffective to have it positioned on earth due to the loss of intensity through the atmosphere. So our best 
            bet would be the moon. Again slowing down would be a huge issue. We could invert the pane so that it slows 
            down from the light of upcomming stars, but that'll be very tricky. <br><br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/uZIOAlJ.png" width="550" height="300" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br><br>
            </li></div>

            <div><li>Anti Matter anhilation : <br>
            Remember nukes ? Their matter to energy conversion rate is barely 1%. What if we rased that upto 100%. 
            something that is achievable through anti matter anhilation. When a particle and an anti particle collide 
            they release a ton of pure energy, leaving nothing behind. Having just a few kilograms of this fuel on board
            could accelerate the ship to half the speed of light (150000 km/s) making the trip to last just 9 years or 
            even less. The only issue is that creating 1 gram of anti matter costs 3 times the GDP of entire USA or 
            62 trillion dollars. Scientist have been able to only create individual subatomic anti-particles, but 
            nothing on a industrial scale. So unless a breakthrouh happens, anti-matter propulsion is sadly off the 
            table as well. <br><br>

            </li></div>

            <div><li>Black Holes : <br>
            As we know, black hole emit hawking radiation. The bigger they are, the less they radiate. The smaller they 
            are, the more they do. And in the process of radiating they slowly evaporate. But this very radiation could 
            power our spaceship. We'll need a very very small black hole with a mass of about 1 trillion kilogram, 
            making its size similar to that of proton. Its power could accelerate the rocket to near light speed, making 
            it perfect energy source. But we can't just go hunting for microscopic black holes and then caging them. We 
            have to make our own. The most effective way to do so would be by concentrating a lot of laser beams at one
            point. And by a lot I mean it. A LOT. We might need planet size lasers concentrating their power into one 
            single microscopic point. All that energy density would create something known as Kugelblitz - a black hole 
            made not of matter but light. In other words the black hole could act as a container for all that energy and 
            slowly release it back powering the ship. Perhaps a dyson sphere collector around the sun would provide 
            enough energy to act as a laser. But I doubt that's happening anytime soon. <br><br>

            <b>Up until now all solution include slower than light speed. The next one presents a faster than light 
            solution </b><br><br>

            <div><li>Alcubierre Warp Drive : <br>
            We did say that moving faster than light is impossible. Its certainly true, if we try to overtake light ray 
            on the same density of spacetime. Spacetime is the fundamental fabric of the universe. But if we distort the 
            spacetime around us so that the fabric in front of us would get shrunk, while that behind us would expand we 
            create something akin of spacetime wave. Instead of making you faster, it makes the distance you have to 
            travel through spacetime shorter. That would able to make you travel faster than light without breaking 
            laws of physics since you'd still travel at normal speeds just inside of the warp bubble. Distance would now
            become meaningless as you could travel a billion of light years in days, all depending on the power of our
            spaceship. So how can we distort spacetime ? By a lot of negative energy density and uncertainity. Its 
            certainly possible. We even have NASA research on this topic. <br><br>

        <h1>2. Difference in Real Science and Pseudo Science </h1>
        There are a lot of concepts which tell themself as real science and but aren't. They're pseudo science. Pseudo 
        means fake. It is necessary to differentiate real science and pseudo science as it may save you some money. 
        So lets see those. <br><br>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/BC8UUYn.png" width="750" height="400" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br><br>
        So we are not even going to speak about thease 3 one's. If you believe in any one of them, 
        I'm sorry for you. <br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>Evolution Denial : <br>
            Pretty much on par with young earth creationism this might be hottest point in the totally peaceful debate 
            between religious and non-religious humans. Evolution is a theory but so is gravity and relativity. 
            Humans didn't evolved from apes, but a comman ancestor and there are no missing links. Also 97% of scientist 
            believe in evolution.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Astrology : <br>
            The belief that constellations thousands of light years away that look nothing like their name predicts that 
            you will meet a old schoolmate this sunday. Also take into account that because thease stars are moving, in 
            100000 years from now all constellations will become unrecognisable. <br><br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/5yNnPtC.png" width="750" height="400" alt="Image unavailable"/><br>
            <br>
            </li>

            <li>Parapsychology : <br>
            This as expected has nothing to do with psychology or with science altogeother. It implies that human may have 
            superpowers, like telekinesis the ability of affect matter with some kind of brain force. Here are the only 
            4 fundamental forces of the universe <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Electromagnetism</li>
                <li>Weak interaction</li>
                <li>Strong interaction</li>
                <li>Gravitation</li>
            </ol><br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/qlY06Lw.png" width="750" height="400"/><br><br>
            And none of them have anything to do with the brain. Also the 1 million dollar challenge, where anyone who could 
            demonstrate a paranormal ability would be given a million dollars. From 1964 to today nobody was successful.
            However telephathy will soon become a reality, as brain-to-brain communication technology is on the rise. <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>New Age : <br>
            When randomly generated text sound the same as the actual thing, you know its serious. The New Age movement 
            is a bunch of belief inspired by Eastern religion in which humans are somehow special and can reach their 
            higher self through different practices. Most of their self help books use the scientific words in 
            purposefully vague context, having now scientific basis. <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Quantum bullshit : <br>
            It is in the same boat as of New age. It mean new age ideas delibrately containing the word "quantum" inside 
            in order to confuse people. However to anyone with some knowledge of actual quantum mechanics it will seem pure 
            comedy.<br><br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/22BUmNx.png" width="650" height="400" alt="Image unavailable"/><br>
            <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Aliens : <br>
            Have you ever seen an UFO ? While it is almost certain that they do exists somewhere far away, all of the existing 
            sightings of ufo have been shown to be misnterpreted clouds, camera glitches or simply hoax. After all why 
            would someone in their right mind travel tens of light years just to draw some circles in our fields.<br><br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/yVhbRQc.png" width="750" height="400" alt="Image unavailable"/><br>
            <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Anti vax : <br>
            The anti vaccination movement claims that vaccines cause autism (Serious developmental disorder that impairs 
            the ability to communicate and interact). And guess what scientific evidence they use in support of their 
            claim ? NONE. There are consiparcy theory vlogs and some youtube videos. There is no current scientific research 
            that points any link between autism and vaccination. But even if it was true vaccination would be seriously 
            worth it. <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Homeopathy : <br>
            Homeopathy claims that "Water can cure you just because it once held medicine."<br>
            Its pretty much like saying "you can eat a empty plate because it onec held food". <br>
            Back in 2015, a major study analysing over 1800 studies on homepathy concluded that it is absolutely 
            ineffective and works no better than placebo, that is your body curing itself because it thinks the medicine 
            you take are actually useful when in reality they're not. <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Detoxification : <br>
            The real defination of detoxification is - <b>"The process of getting rid of dangerous levels of drugs, 
            alcohol and or poison like heavy metal from your body in case of life-threating situation."</b><br>
            Now here is the fake defination - "Getting rid of toxins accumulated by eating food"<br><br>
            Guess what science says about thease toxins ? If they were to accumulate, you'd be long dead. What do we have 
            liver and kidney's for ? Whenever anyone mention toxins in food, I imagine a pizza with snake venom in it. 
            Infact injecting snake venom is safe, as it doesn't go in contact with your blood.<br><br>
            </li>
            
            <b>Have you ever wondered why lie detectors are not used in courts ? Because they don't work. In recent study 
            the accuracy of lie detectors has barely got to 65% which is a bit higher than guessing (50%).<br><br>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Rorschach_blot_01.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br>
            What do you see ? A moth ? 2 elephants ? One elephant eating a dead corpse on a vertical mirror ? It doesn't really 
            matter because the Rorschach test have close to no empirical evidence of diagnosing any mental disorder.<br><br>
            </b>

            <li>Hypnosis : <br>
            Without a doubt hypnosis exists and works. What doesn't work is the recalling of deep and long forgotten memories. 
            What actually happens is our brain creates false memories based on the question of hypnotizer.<br><br> 
            </li>

            <li>Acupuncture : <br>
            Remember Homeopathy ? Acupuncture is quite similar. Just the reason it isn't along Homeopathy is that it has 
            some small benifits over Homeopathy. More than 3000 clinical trails proved that it is mostly a placebo. 
            But the advantages like muscle relaxation and anxiety relief doesn't place with with Homeopathy. <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Meditation : <br>
            It does certainly work. It is proven to release stress, depression, increase pain tolerance, self awareness, 
            and inproved memory. However meditation comes with a lot of pseudo-science like chakras, the third eye or 
            other new age belief.<br><br>

        <h1>3. Virtual Particles</h1>
        There are 3am questions like can we experience anything objectively ? what caused the universe to appear ? 
        why it had to appear ? We'll see the explanation of what is cause of everything around us. This about this.. 
        Less than 100 years before the smartest people on earth thought that milky way will exists forever. A bit later 
        thease smart people discovered that there are a lot of galaxies other than milky way and that around 13.8 billion 
        years ago there was a sudden expansion of the universe from an infinitely small singularity for no apparant reason 
        which created everything. They called it Big bang. But we don't know why it even happened. <br><br>
        Okay. Now imagine a emply space with nothing inside it and zoom in the space for very, VERY long time. On 
        quantum level, the empty space is not so empty. There are constantly quantum fluctuations happening all over the 
        place. They're called Virtual Particles. <br><br> 
        <img src="https://imgur.com/YXfIFvX.png" width="600" height="400" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br><br>
        Virtual particles appear and disappear almost instantaneously everywhere. They are called virtual because they 
        borrow some energy from the vacuum, appear, return the energy to the vacuum and then disappear. And just like 
        the viutual particles bubbles of spacetime can do the same. However there is hell lot difference between a single
        virtual particle appearing by itself and a whole universe with hundreds of galaxies. That probably couldn't just 
        spontaneously appear. That has a really REALLY low probability, but in quantum physics if something has even a 
        slightest probablity of happening then it will happen. Nevertheless shouldn't the universe seize out of existance as soon 
        as it appeared just like a virtual particle ? Yes it should only if it were a closed or open universe. In reality our
        universe is flat. And this doesn't mean that the earth is flat. NO !<br><br>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/IFnh97d.png" width="700" height="400" alt="Image unavailable"/><br><br>
        Because of some fancy math, a flat universe is allowed to survive and expand beyond the point of recollapse. 
        Most universe just appear and disappear almost immediately. Seems like we're a bit too lucky to be born in a 
        perfect universe, in a perfect solar system, on a perfect planet. All the positive energy in the form of matter 
        is exactly equal to the negative energy in form of gravitational force created by that mass. It simpley means 
        that everything around us, the energy of whole universe, adds up to exactly zero, which is nothing just from where 
        it began. So universe is just a complicated form of nothing.<br><br>
        
        </div>

        <div>
        <h1>4. Car vs Snail</h1>
        <div>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/UHEJGrG.png" width="1000" height="550" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br><br>
        Imagine there is a race between Lamborghini and snale going on. What if I told you the Lamborghini would never 
        outrun the snail ? Here's how !<br><br>
        Lets give the snail a head start of 100m. As the lamborghini progresses and gets to the start point of snail (100m)
        , it will have travelled say 10m more. By the time the car covers those 10 m the, snail would have travelled 1 more 
        metre. By the time the car goes that metre, the snail will 10cm and so on, 1 cm, 1 mm, 1 micrometre, 1 nm, 1 pm, 1 fm 
        and so on. The car will never catch the snail. <br><br>
        </div>

        <div>
        So did we break the universe ? There's a small problem called as Zeno's Paradox, it implies that you can indefinitely 
        divide the distance. But is this so in reality ? The idea that space is made up of small indivisible stuff dates back 
        too ancient greece. They through everthing was made up of small pebbles which they called atoms. And they're really 
        small. A cube of sugar contains as many atoms as there are stars in the universe. In 20th century scientist discovered 
        that thease indivisible particles of matter are actually divisible. As they contain of protons, neutrons and 
        electrons. In 1968 scientist actually discovered protons and neutrons were made up to 3 smaller which they're called 
        Quarks. Protons are made of 2 up and 1 down quark, while neutrons with 2 down and 1 up quark. Togeother with 
        electrons they form the elementary particles of universe. <br><br>
        There are a lot of other small things. <br>
        </div>

        <div>
        There is a theory called as string theory. It replaces fundamental particles with 1 dimensional strings. Thease 
        string vibrate in different patterns to form different particles. The size of the string is equal to that of 
        Plank Length which is about 10<sup>-35</sup> metre or 60 quantillion times smaller than electron. But we can't 
        see it. Because to see an object we need photons, which bounces off an object and reaches our eyes. 
        But the photons wavelength is way bigger than strings. So the photons would not bounce off and we won't be able
        to see it. In order to see it we have to reduce the wavelength of photons, for which we need extreme energy 
        such extreme energy would create a microscopic black hole. <br><br>
        </div>

        <div>
        Okay back to our race. In reality when the car reaches the plank length, there'll be no further division of 
        matter possible anymore. So the car will finally outrun the snail. <br><br>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h1>5. Matter Decay</h1>
        Everything in this universe dies. Humans, animals, birds, even viruses and bacteria which aren't even alive 
        at first place. In order to understand matter decay we need to know energy levels. For example when we are working 
        or learning something useful, you are in your highest energy state. Yet we always try to get to a lower energy 
        state which we call Laziness by sitting on couch or playing the new God of War. And you might think this is the 
        laziest you can get, when in reality you can go even further. By sleeping which is the minimum energy level possible.
        But for a real example think of a ball at the top of hill. It is very unstable having a lot of potential energy 
        which it tries to get rid of by going on a more stable surface. Once there the ball is considered stable. However 
        it may turn out that there is a even lower and more stable level, making the current metastable. And this is pretty 
        much how the energy field in the universe works. <br><br>

        <img src="https://imgur.com/eRr8wGG.png" width="700" height="500" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br><br>

        The electron field, the photon field, the graviton field all of them exists at minimum energy levels, making them 
        truly stable. However some research shows that there is something wrong with the higgs field - the one that gives 
        the particle mass. Those calculation says that the higgs field might not be at a minimum energy level creating 
        a false vacuum. It would also make the field metastable that is if it'd given a small push the ball would fly off 
        the edge. That small push could be powerful enough excitation of field, like an incredibly powerful supernova or 
        a very energetic particle collision. And if the higgs field changes it value - all hell will break lose. <br><br>

        The disturbance point would convert all the nearby space to same energy level. That would mean that a sphere of 
        true vacuum would start expanding at the speed of light. The vacuum inside the sphere is at a lower energy state 
        that the outer one. Everything that comes in contact of the surface of sphere would be anhilated. Its like 
        factory restore of the universe. What makes it better is that the universe inside the death-sphere would have 
        different laws of physics. And we don't know which one. The new law might not allow atoms to form. There might 
        be new type of particle that we can't imagine. Maybe if gravity were to exists it would work only when you look 
        down ? It all depends on the property of new higgs field. And the death sphere would move at the speed of light. 
        And you know what's faster than speed of light ? Light ! So we won't notice the sphere unless its right on our 
        face. It'll continue to expand until it engulf the entire universe, allowing for a new one to be born inside it which
        may not support life. Or if it did it'll leave no trace of previous false vacuum. So even if any civilisation 
        developed it would only guess of any such event. Maybe it has already happen and big bang was in reality a vacuum 
        decay. But.. <br><br>

        The death sphere would only be expanding at the speed of light which is not that fast as compared to expansion of
        universe. If it happened somewhere far from us there is a good chance that due to universe expansion it'll never 
        even reach us.
