        <h1>1. Nathan Rose</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        Nathan Rosen (March 22, 1909 – December 18, 1995) was an American-Israeli physicist noted for his study on 
        the structure of the hydrogen atom and his work with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky on entangled wave 
        functions and the EPR paradox. The Einstein–Rosen bridge, later named the wormhole, was a theory of Nathan Rosen.
        Nathan Rosen was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He attended MIT during the Great Depression, 
        where he received a bachelor's degree in electromechanical engineering and later a master's and a doctorate in 
        physics. As a student he published several papers of note, one being "The Neutron," which attempted to explain 
        the structure of the atomic nucleus a year before their discovery by James Chadwick. He also developed an 
        interest in wave functions, and later, gravitation, when he worked as a fellow at the University of Michigan and 
        Princeton University. <br><br></div>

        <div>
        Later in his life, Nathan Rosen turned his attentions to teaching and the establishment of new universities. 
        After briefly working for two years in the Soviet Union at the University of Kiev starting in 1936, he returned to 
        the United States, where he taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1941 to 1952. In 1953, 
        after permanently moving to Israel, he joined the Technion in Haifa, Israel. During this time Rosen was advisor to 
        Asher Peres. Technion now has a lecture series named for him. He was President of the Ben-Gurion University of the 
        Negev in the 1970s and commuted between the two institutions from his home in Haifa. Additionally, Nathan Rosen 
        helped found the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Physical Society of Israel (serving as president 
        from 1955–57), and the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation (president 1974-77). He was very 
        active in encouraging the founding of higher educational institutions in Israel.<br><br>

        <b>Rosen made a number of contributions to modern physics. One of the most lasting discoveries Rosen brought 
        to physics was his formulation of the structure of the hydrogen molecule, a molecule where none of the electrons 
        have a definite quantum number, but the pair of electrons has a pure state. Rosen used what he called "entangled" 
        wave functions to represent the molecule's structure. He also developed a theoretical analysis of the neutron as 
        combination of proton and electron in an article in Physical Review 1931</b>

        <h1>2. Boris Podolsky</h1>
        <div>
        Boris Yakovlevich Podolsky (Russian: Бори́с Я́ковлевич Подо́льский; 29 June 1896 – 28 November 1966) was a 
        Russian-American physicist of Russian Jewish descent, noted for his work with Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen 
        on entangled wave functions and the EPR paradox. In 1896, Boris Podolsky was born into a poor Jewish family in 
        Taganrog, in the Don Host Oblast of the Russian Empire, and he moved to the United States in 1913. After 
        receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California in 
        1918, he served in the US Army and then worked at the Los Angeles Bureau of Power and Light. In 1926, he 
        obtained an MS in Mathematics from the University of Southern California. In 1928, he received a PhD in
        Theoretical Physics (under Paul Sophus Epstein) from Caltech. In a letter dated November 10, 1933, to Abraham 
        Flexner, founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Einstein described Podolsky as 
        "one of the most brilliant of the younger men who has worked and published with [Paul] Dirac." In 1935 Einstein 
        and others at the Institute wrote letters of recommendation for Podolsky, addressed to Louis T. More, Dean of the 
        Graduate School of the University of Cincinnati, in which Einstein wrote, "I am happy to be able to tell you that 
        I estimate Podolsky’s abilities very highly.. he is an independent investigator of unquestionable talent."
        </div><br><br>

        <div>
        Working with Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen, Podolsky conceived the EPR paradox. This famous paper stimulated 
        debate as to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, culminating with Bell's theorem and the advent of quantum 
        information theory. In 1933, Podolsky and Lev Landau had the idea to write a textbook on electromagnetism 
        beginning with special relativity and emphasizing theoretical postulates rather than experimental laws. This 
        project did not come to fruition due to Podolsky's return to the United States, where he had immigrated in 1913. 
        However, in the hands of Lev Landau and E. Lifshitz, the outline they produced became The Classical Theory of 
        Fields (1951). On the same basis, Podolsky and K. Kunz produced Fundamentals of Electrodynamics, Marcel Dekker 
        Press (1969), to which Podolsky's son, Robert, contributed most of the questions at the end of each chapter.

        <h1>3. Max Plank</h1>
        <div>
        Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck,  (23 April 1858 – 4 October 1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose 
        discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Planck made many contributions to 
        theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, 
        which revolutionized human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. <br><br>

        <b>Signature of Sir Max Plank at the age of 10</b>
        </div>

        <div>
        Planck was born in 1858 in Kiel, Holstein, to Johann Julius Wilhelm Planck and his second wife, Emma Patzig. He 
        was baptized with the name of Karl Ernst Ludwig Marx Planck; of his given names, Marx (a now obsolete variant of 
        Markus or maybe simply an error for Max, which is actually short for Maximilian) was indicated as the "appellation 
        name". However, by the age of ten he signed with the name Max and used this for the rest of his life. In 1867 the 
        family moved to Munich, and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians gymnasium school, where he came under the tutelage 
        of Hermann Müller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him astronomy and mechanics as 
        well as mathematics. It was from Müller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. Planck 
        graduated early, at age 17. This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics. Planck was gifted 
        when it came to music. He took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. 
        However, instead of music he chose to study physics. The Munich physics professor Philipp von Jolly advised 
        Planck against going into physics, saying, "In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that 
        remains is to fill a few holes."[11] Planck replied that he did not wish to discover new things, but only to 
        understand the known fundamentals of the field, and so began his studies in 1874 at the University of Munich. 
        Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the diffusion 
        of hydrogen through heated platinum, but transferred to theoretical physics. With the completion of his 
        habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid Privatdozent (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant 
        professor) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. Although he was initially ignored by the 
        academic community, he furthered his work on the field of heat theory and discovered one after another the same 
        thermodynamical formalism as Gibbs without realizing it. Clausius's ideas on entropy occupied a central role in 
        his work.<br><br>

        <h1>4. Erwin Schrödinger</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger ( 12 August 1887 – 4 January 1961), sometimes written as Erwin Schrodinger 
        or Erwin Schroedinger, was a Nobel Prize-winning Austrian-Irish physicist who developed a number of fundamental 
        results in quantum theory: the Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and 
        how it changes dynamically in time. In addition, he was the author of many works on various aspects of physics: 
        statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity,
        and cosmology, and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. In his book What Is Life? 
        Schrödinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. 
        He paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, 
        and religion. He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology. He is also known for his "Schrödinger's cat" 
        thought-experiment.He wrote around 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of unified field 
        theory. The first publications of Schrödinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only 
        from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and Wolfgang Pauli and his move 
        to Germany
        </div>

        <div>
        He created the Schrödinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis 
        of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical 
        nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, which 
        suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of 
        emission of radiation). Although the experiments of Hans Geiger and Walther Bothe soon cast doubt on this, the idea 
        of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schrödinger. Following his work on quantum 
        mechanics, Schrödinger devoted considerable effort to working on a unified field theory that would unite gravity,
        electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework of General Relativity, doing the work with an 
        extended correspondence with Albert Einstein. In 1947, he announced a result, "Affine Field Theory," in a talk at 
        the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement was criticized by Einstein as "preliminary" and failed to lead to 
        the desired unified theory. Following the failure of his attempt at unification, Schrödinger gave up his work on 
        unification and turned to other topics. In January 1926, Schrödinger published in Annalen der Physik the paper 
        "Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem" (Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem) on wave mechanics and presented what 
        is now known as the Schrödinger equation
        </div>

        <div>
        Schrödinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. He wrote about the probability 
        interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it." 
        (Just in order to ridicule the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics he contrived the famous 
        thought-experiment called Schrödinger's cat paradox.)<br><br>

        <h1>5. Lise Meitner</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
        In 1944, Otto Hahn was awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery of nuclear fission. Austrian-born 
        Meitner, who both initiated the project with Hahn and offered the insight (with her nephew) that explained Hahn’s 
        experimental findings, was – shockingly – not credited by either the Nobel committee or her one-time partner. Meitner, 
        who was Jewish, had been forced to leave her work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry and escape Germany 
        in 1938. She ended up in Sweden, without the money or the institutional support to restart her research, but she 
        continued corresponding with Hahn. In 1997 the heavy element meitnerium was named in her honour. While working at 
        the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute on radioactivity, she discovered protactinium-231 as a radioactive isotope in 1917. 
        Soon after fleeing from Nazi Germany to Sweden in 1938, she and nephew-physicist Otto Robert Frisch discovered 
        nuclear fission. She was praised by Albert Einstein as the "German Marie Curie". Completing her doctoral research 
        in 1905, Meitner became the first female from the University of Vienna and second in the world to earn a doctorate 
        in physics. Meitner spent most of her scientific career in Berlin, Germany, where she was a physics professor and a 
        department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute; she was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in 
        Germany.
        </div>

        <div>
        In mid-1938, Meitner with chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute found that 
        bombarding thorium with neutrons produced different isotopes. Hahn and Strassmann later in the year showed that 
        isotopes of barium could be formed by bombardment of uranium. In late December, Meitner and Frisch quickly 
        worked out the phenomenon of such splitting process. In their report in February issue of Nature in 1939, they 
        gave the name "fission". This principle led to the development of the first atomic bomb during World War II, and 
        the subsequently other nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Encouraged and backed by her father's financial 
        support, Meitner went to the Friedrich Wilhelm University in the Dahlem district of Berlin, where the renowned 
        physicist Max Planck taught. Planck invited her to his home, and allowed her to attend his lectures, which was an 
        unusual gesture by Planck, who was on the record as being opposing women being admitted to universities in general, 
        but was willing to admit that there was the occasional exception; apparently he recognised Meitner as one of the 
        exceptions. She became friends with Planck's twin daughters Emma and Grete, who shared her love of music.
