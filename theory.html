    <h2>1. String Theory</h2>
    <div class="statement">string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle 
    physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. We consider point particles like fermion, gluon, lepton,
    as the fundamental paticles. Which means that they are not composed of anything else in the universe. But some scientist
    thought that what is more complex than a point ? A line ! And so they came up a hypothetical idea of Strings. 
    Strings are 1-dimensional objects which have certain unique vibration patterns for each of the fundamental particle.
    String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales 
    larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other 
    properties determined by the vibrational state of the string.</div><br><br>

    <div class="pr"><p>The original version of string theory was bosonic string theory, but this version described only 
    bosons, a class of particles which transmit forces between the matter particles, or fermions. Bosonic string theory 
    was eventually superseded by theories called superstring theories. These theories describe both bosons and fermions, 
    and they incorporate a theoretical idea called supersymmetry. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a 
    counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. The superstring theory is another attempt which is completely based
    on the concept of strings. It is an attempt to explain all of the particles and fundamental forces of nature in one 
    theory by modeling them as vibrations of tiny supersymmetric strings. Superstring theory' is a shorthand for 
    supersymmetric string theory</p></div>

    particle. And as they vibrate they emit different colour bands. Each one different from other </b><br><br>

    <b>The Superstring Theory also deals with multiple dimensions. As told here bosonic string theory (which only explains
    about bosons) has 26-dimensions, superstring theory has 10-dimensions and M theory has 11-dimensions</b><br><br>

    <h2 class="head">2. M Theory or Multi-Dimensional Theory</h2>
    <div class="statement">M-theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory.
    According to Edward Witten, M should stand for "magic", "mystery" or "membrane" according to taste, and the true 
    meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known. Although a 
    complete formulation of M-theory is not known, such a formulation should describe two- and five-dimensional objects 
    called branes and should be approximated by eleven-dimensional supergravity at low energies. M-theory may provide a 
    framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory 
    to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of the 
    four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed in high-energy 
    physics experiments.<br><br>
    The fundamentals of M theory are - 
    <ul>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>Branes</li>
        <li>D-brane</li>
    </ul></div>

    <b>This is a speculation of M theory. It uses the superstring theory and hypothesize that there should be atleast 
    11-dimensions.</b></div>

    <br>Here are some predictions what you'll be able to do from 2 dimension to 11 dimension
    <ol>
        <li>2-dimension - In a 2d world you would have a vision of 1d. So if anything passes infront of you. You'll see
            infinitely small division of the object passing corresponding to your 1d. Just as an MRI scan views your brain.
        </li>
        <li>4-dimension - If a tesseract passes through our 3d world we would see it as shape changing object. And if we 
            consider time as 4th dimension then we could change our age as our will. 
        </li>
        <li>5-dimension - It'd allow us to travel through all the parallel universe that has same initial co-ordinate 
            as our universe.
        </li>
        <li>6-dimension - It'll allow us to travel through time in all of the parallel universe having same initial 
            co-ordinates as ours.
        </li>
        <li>7-dimension - We could travel to any possible world without no matter what their initial co-ordinates is.</li>
        <li>8-dimension - We could travel in time in any of the universe having any initial co-ordinates</li>
        <li>9-dimension - We can compare all the possible universe history starting with all the different possible laws of 
            physics and initial condition. </li>
        <li>10-dimension - In this and final dimension we'll arrive at a point where everything possible and imaginable is 
            covered. Beyond this nothing can be imagined by us mortals which makes it the natural limitation of what we can 
            concieve in terms of dimension.</li>

    <h2 class="head">3. Hollow Moon Theory</h2>
    <div class="statement"><p>Hollow moon theory is a hypothetical theory that states that The moon is hollow from inside.
    In 1970, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, of what was then the Soviet Academy of Sciences, advanced a 
    hypothesis that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. The article was entitled "Is the Moon the 
    Creation of Alien Intelligence?", and was published in Sputnik, the Soviet equivalent of Reader's Digest. 
    The authors reference earlier speculation by astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky, who suggested that the Martian moon 
    Phobos was an artificial satellite and hollow; this has since been shown to not be the case. Sceptical author Jason 
    Colavito points out that all of their evidence is circumstantial, and that in the 1960s the atheistic Soviet Union 
    promoted the ancient astronaut concept in an attempt to undermine the West's faith in religion</p></div>

    <div class="pr">The postulates on which it is said that the moon is hollow is <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Apolo Mission -</li>
        <li>During an Apolo mission when they took off from the surface of moon, they saw that the surface of the moon
            kept vibrating for several days as if its hollow from inside. This lead some scientist to believe that moon
            is hollow from inside.</li>
        <li>The fact that the Moon is less dense than the Earth is advanced as support for it to be hollow. The moon's 
            mean density is 3.3 g/cm3 whereas the Earth's is 5.5 g/cm3. One explanation of this discrepancy is that 
            the moon may have been formed by a giant impact which ejected some of the early Earth's upper crust into its 
            orbit. The Earth's upper mantle and crust are less dense than its core.</li>
