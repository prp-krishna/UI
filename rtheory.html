    <h1>1. Quantum Field Theory</h1>
    <div class="pr">
    <p>In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, 
    special relativity and quantum mechanics, but not general relativity's description of gravity. QFT is used in 
    particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct 
    models of quasiparticles. QFT treats particles as excited states (also called quanta) of their underlying fields, 
    which are more fundamental than the particles. Interactions between particles are described by interaction terms in 
    the Lagrangian involving their corresponding fields. Each interaction can be visually represented by Feynman diagrams 
    according to perturbation theory in quantum mechanics.</p></div>

        <div><li><b>Classical Field Theory : </b><br><br>
        A classical field theory is a physical theory that predicts how one or more physical fields interact with matter 
        through field equations. The term 'classical field theory' is commonly reserved for describing those physical 
        theories that describe electromagnetism and gravitation, two of the fundamental forces of nature.<br><br>

        <b>This is Einstein Field Equation </b><br><br>
        The first field theories, Newtonian gravitation and Maxwell's equations of electromagnetic fields were developed in 
        classical physics before being a part of relativity theory in 1905, and had to be revised to be consistent with that 
        theory. Consequently, classical field theories are usually categorized as non-relativistic and relativistic.

        <div><li><b>Quantum Mechanics  : </b><br><br>
        Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of 
        nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including 
        quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.Classical physics, 
        the description of physics that existed before the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, describes many 
        aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, while quantum mechanics explains the aspects of nature at 
        small (atomic and subatomic) scales, for which classical mechanics is insufficient. Most theories in classical 
        physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale

        <b>Wavefunctions of the electron in a hydrogen atom at different energy levels. Quantum mechanics cannot predict 
        the exact location of a particle in space, only the probability of finding it at different locations. The brighter 
        areas represent a higher probability of finding the electron.</b><br><br>
        
        Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities 
        of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles 
        and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be 
        predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions <br><br>

        There are some examples for Quantum Mechanics : <br><br>
        1. Free Particle<br>For example, consider a free particle. In quantum mechanics, a free matter is described by a 
        wave function. The particle properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its position and velocity. The 
        wave properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference. The 
        wave–particle duality feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators in the formulation of 
        quantum mechanics. Since the matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be represented 
        as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function. The Uncertainty Principle states that 
        both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one can 
        measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function 
        that is very large (a Dirac delta) at a particular position x, and zero everywhere else. If one performs a 
        position measurement on such a wave function, the resultant x will be obtained with 100% probability. 
        This is called an eigenstate of position<br><br>

        2. Particle in a box<br> The particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically 
        simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels. The box is defined as having zero 
        potential energy everywhere inside a certain region, and therefore infinite potential energy everywhere outside 
        that region. For the one-dimensional case in the x {\displaystyle x} x direction, the time-independent Schrödinger 
        equation may be written.<br><br>

        part (blue) and imaginary part (red) of the wavefunction. The states (B,C,D) are energy eigenstates, but (E,F) are not.</b>

        3. Finite potential well<br>A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well 
        problem to potential wells having finite depth.The finite potential well problem is mathematically more 
        complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls 
        of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is 
        nonzero in regions outside the well.<br>

        <div><li><b>Special Relativity : </b><br><br>
        In physics, the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory regarding 
        the relationship between space and time. In Albert Einstein's original treatment, it is based on two postulates:<br><br>

        1. The laws of physics are invariant (i.e., identical) in all inertial frames of reference (i.e., non-accelerating 
        frames of reference); <br>
        2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.<br><br>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/World_line.svg/200px-World_line.svg.png" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br>

        <b>Principle of relativity, Theory of relativity, Doubly special relativity, de Sitter invariant special 
        relativity, General relativity</b><br><br>

        Einstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most assured, regardless of the exact 
        validity of the (then) known laws of either mechanics or electrodynamics. These propositions were the constancy 
        of the speed of light in a vacuum and the independence of physical laws (especially the constancy of the speed 
        of light) from the choice of inertial system. In his initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he 
        expressed these postulates as:<br><br>

        1. The Principle of Relativity – the laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected, 
        whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems in uniform translatory motion 
        relative to each other<br><br>

        2. The Principle of Invariant Light Speed – "... light is always propagated in empty space with a definite 
        velocity [speed] c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body" (from the preface). That is, 
        light in vacuum propagates with the speed c (a fixed constant, independent of direction) in at least one system of 
        inertial coordinates (the "stationary system"), regardless of the state of motion of the light source.<br><br>

        Following are the principles of relativity : <br><br>

        1. Reference frame and Relative Motion : <br>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Frames_of_reference_in_relative_motion.svg/300px-Frames_of_reference_in_relative_motion.svg.png" alt="Image Unavailable"/><br>
        <b>The primed system is in motion relative to the unprimed system with constant velocity v only along the x-axis, 
        from the perspective of an observer stationary in the unprimed system. By the principle of relativity, an observer 
        stationary in the primed system will view a likewise construction except that the velocity they record will be −v. 
        The changing of the speed of propagation of interaction from infinite in non-relativistic mechanics to a finite 
        value will require a modification of the transformation equations mapping events in one frame to another.</b><br><br>
        
        2. Standard Configuration : <br>
        Since there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory, a concept of 'moving' doesn't strictly exist, 
        as everything may be moving with respect to some other reference frame. Instead, any two frames that move at the 
        same speed in the same direction are said to be comoving. Therefore, S and S′ are not comoving. 
        Using the above figure as reference : <br>
        - The x, y, z axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S′.<br>
        - Frame S′ moves, for simplicity, in a single direction: the x-direction of frame S with a constant velocity v as measured in frame S. <br>
        - The origins of frames S and S′ are coincident when time t = 0 for frame S and t′ = 0 for frame S′.<br><br>

        3. Lack of an absolute reference frame : <br>
        The principle of relativity, which states that physical laws have the same form in each inertial reference frame,
        the existence of electromagnetic waves led some physicists to suggest that the universe was filled with a 
        substance that they called "aether", which, they postulated, would act as the medium through which these waves, 
        or vibrations, propagated (in many respects similar to the way sound propagates through air). The aether was 
        thought to be an absolute reference frame against which all speeds could be measured, and could be considered 
        fixed and motionless relative to Earth or some other fixed reference point. The aether supposedly possessed some 
        wonderful properties: it was sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic waves, and those waves could interact 
        with matter, yet it offered no resistance to bodies passing through it (its one property was that it allowed 
        electromagnetic waves to propagate). <br><br>

        4.Relativity without second postulate : <br>
        From the principle of relativity alone without assuming the constancy of the speed of light (i.e., using the 
        isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity) it can be shown that the 
        spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian. In the 
        Lorentzian case, one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and a certain finite limiting speed. 
        Experiments suggest that this speed is the speed of light in vacuum<br><br>

    <h1>2. Einstein's Theory of Relativity </h1>
    The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein:<br><br> 
    - General relativity and <br>
    - Special relativity.<br><br>
    <div>
    Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law 
    of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, 
    including astronomy.  It introduced concepts including spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity 
    of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, 
    relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in 
    the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as 
    neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves<br><br>
    </div>

    <div>
    The term "theory of relativity" was based on the expression "relative theory" (German: Relativtheorie) used in 1906 
    by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same 
    paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression "theory of relativity". The special theory of relativity 
    rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic 
    physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics. <br><br>
    </div>

    <div>
    But the general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of 
    Newtonian gravitation theory. It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, as most of its assertions 
    were on an astronomical scale. Its mathematics seemed difficult and fully understandable only by a small number of 
    people. Around 1960, general relativity became central to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to 
    apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical 
    phenomena were discovered, such as quasars (1963), the 3-kelvin microwave background radiation (1965), pulsars (1967), 
    and the first black hole candidates (1981), the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them further 
    confirmed the theory. <br><br>

        <li>General Relativity : <br>
        General relativity (GR), also known as the general theory of relativity (GTR), is the geometric theory of 
        gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. 
        General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a 
        unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In 
        particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and 
        radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential 
        equations. Some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics, 
        especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the 
        propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, 
        the gravitational redshift of light, the gravitational time delay and singularities/black holes. The predictions 
        of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to 
        date. Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that 
        is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general 
        relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of 
        quantum gravity. <br><br>

    <h1>Quantum Physics vs Quantum Mechanics</h1>
    
    <div>
    Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at its most fundamental level. A central tenet of quantum physics 
    is that energy comes in indivisible packets called quanta. Quanta behave very differently to macroscopic matter: 
    particles can behave like waves, and waves behave as though they are particles. Quantum physics underlies how atoms 
    work, and so why chemistry and biology work as they do. You, me and the gatepost – at some level at least, we’re all 
    dancing to the quantum tune. If you want to explain how electrons move through a computer chip, how photons of light 
    get turned to electrical current in a solar panel or amplify themselves in a laser, or even just how the sun keeps 
    burning, you’ll need to use quantum physics.<br><br>
    </div>

    <div>
    At a basic level, quantum physics predicts very strange things about 
    how matter works that are completely at odds with how things seem to work in the real world. Quantum particles can 
    behave like particles, located in a single place; or they can act like waves, distributed all over space or in 
    several places at once. How they appear seems to depend on how we choose to measure them, and before we measure they 
    seem to have no definite properties at all – leading us to a fundamental conundrum about the nature of basic reality.
    This fuzziness leads to apparent paradoxes such as Schrödinger’s cat, in which thanks to an uncertain quantum process 
    a cat is left dead and alive at the same time. But that’s not all. Quantum particles also seem to be able to affect 
    each other instantaneously even when they are far away from each other. This truly bamboozling phenomenon is known as 
    entanglement, or, in a phrase coined by Einstein (a great critic of quantum theory), “spooky action at a distance”. 
    Such quantum powers are completely foreign to us, yet are the basis of emerging technologies such as ultra-secure 
    quantum cryptography and ultra-powerful quantum computing. But as to what it all means, no one knows. Some people 
    think we must just accept that quantum physics explains the material world in terms we find impossible to square 
    with our experience in the larger, “classical” world. Others think there must be some better, more intuitive theory 
    out there that we’ve yet to discover.<br><br>

    Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of 
    nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum 
    chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science. It attempts to describe and 
    account for the properties of molecules and atoms and their constituents—electrons, protons, neutrons, and other 
    more esoteric particles such as quarks and gluons. These properties include the interactions of the particles with 
    one another and with electromagnetic radiation (i.e., light, X-rays, and gamma rays). It attempts to describe and

    So the basic difference between Quantum Physics and Quantum Mechanics is : <br><br>
    -- Quantum Physics deals with all the theoretical part of universe. It lays the framework to make an assumption and 
    convert that assumption into a full flessed theory on the basis of observations and calculations that is the mechanics 
    part.<br><br>
    -- On the other hand Quantum Mechanics confirms the observed phenomenon or a theory by implementing it into reality 
    on a mathematical basis thus creating various equation and laying the basic mathematical foundation for the universe.
